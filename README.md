# Paint The Circle Project

This project identifies and paints circles given in RGB images. Specifically, each input image contains a rectangle, a triangle, and a circle. The image is fed into a neural network, whose outputs are the center and radius of the circle within the image. The domain considered is "[0,1]x[0,1] "box". The goal is to "paint" the circle.

For this project we used Jupyter Notebook with Python to create our DL model.
